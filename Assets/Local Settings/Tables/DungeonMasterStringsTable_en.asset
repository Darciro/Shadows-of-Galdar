    m_Localized: "<b>- Do the dead scare you? - asked Ser Waymar Royce with no more
      than a hint of a smile on his face.</b>\r\n\r\n<color=#FF0000>Gared</color>
      didn't take the bait. He was an old man, over fifty, and had seen the nobles
      come and go.\r\n\r\n- <i>A dead man is a dead man</i> - he replied. - We have
      nothing to do with the dead.\r\n\r\n- But are they dead? - Royce asked softly.
      - What proof do we have of that?\r\n\r\n- Will saw them,\u2019 said Gared.
      - If he says they're dead, that's proof enough for me.\r\n\r\nWill already
      knew that they would drag him into the discussion sooner or later. He wished
      it had been later.\r\n\r\n- My mum told me that dead people don't sing,\u2019
      Will said.\r\n\r\n- \u2018My wet nurse said the same thing, Will,\u2019 Royce
      replied. - Never believe anything you hear next to a woman's chest. There are
      things to be learnt even from the dead,\u2019 his voice echoed, too loud in
      the dimness of the forest.\r\n\r\n- We have a long ride ahead of us,\u2019
      Gared emphasised. - Eight days, maybe nine. And night is about to fall.\r\n\r\nSer
      Waymar Royce glanced disinterestedly at the sky.\r\n\r\n- That happens every
      day at this time. Do you lose your virility in the dark, Gared?\r\n\r\nWill
      saw Gared's mouth tighten, the anger only barely suppressed in the eyes that
      peered out from under the thick black hood of his cloak. He had spent forty
      years in the Night's Watch, from the time he was a young boy to the time he
      became a man, and he wasn't used to being devalued. But it was more than that.
      Will could detect in the older man something else beneath the wounded pride.
      He could taste it: a nervous tension that came dangerously close to fear.\r\n\r\nWill
      shared the other man's discomfort. He had been on the Wall for four years.
      When he had been sent there, all the old stories had resurfaced in his mind,
      and his insides had turned to water. He was now a veteran of a hundred patrols,
      and the dark, endless wilderness that the men of the south called the haunted
      forest no longer terrified him.\r\n\r\nUntil that night. Something seemed different
      then. There was something threatening in that darkness that made the hairs
      on the back of his neck stand on end. They had been riding for nine days, north
      and north-west, and then north again, each time further from the Wall, following
      the trail of a band of savage raiders without diversions. Each day had been
      worse than the last. This one had been the worst of all. A cold wind blew from
      the north and made the trees rustle like living things. All day long, Will
      had had the feeling that something was watching him, something cold and implacable
      that didn't like him. Gared had felt it too. Will wanted with all his might
      to ride quickly back to the safety of the Wall, but this was not a feeling
      he could share with a commander.\r\n\r\n"
